Gen Z and the EMI Life: Survival Hack or Debt Trap?

Opening claim. Gen Z didn’t invent debt—but they did make it frictionless. In the UK, two in five adults have now used buy-now-pay-later (BNPL). That’s roughly 22.6 million people, and the curve is still rising. If your checkout has a pastel button that promises “four easy payments,” you’re already living in the new credit culture.

The convenience case. BNPL and EMIs turn a “no” into a “not yet.” Klarna alone says it has 11 million UK customers and grew UK revenue 30% in 2024—proof that flexible payments widen access and smooth cash-flow shocks. Used well, it’s budgeting with better UX. And at a system level, governments acknowledge that spreading payments, when affordable, supports consumption—which still makes up the majority of GDP in mature markets.

The caution flag. The UK regulator is worried enough to move. The government consulted on bringing BNPL into regulation in late-2024, and the FCA followed with a 2025 paper noting the market jumped from £60 million in 2017 to over £13 billion in 2024—massive growth without full guardrails. Translation: scale first, safety later.

The frontline reality check. Advice charities are triaging the fallout. Citizens Advice says people seeking help for BNPL issues more than tripled between 2022 and 2024; in 2025, 82% of those clients were struggling with repayments. That’s not “fun money”—that’s people in distress.

Zoom out: the Gen Z pattern. In the U.S., the CFPB finds more than one-fifth of consumers used BNPL by 2022, with a growing cohort of heavy users opening a new BNPL loan about once a month. Late-payment slippage is rising too: 41% of BNPL users say they were late in the past year, up from 34%. This is exactly the usage profile that can spiral when incomes wobble.

Why Gen Z is different (and vulnerable).

Interface over introspection. One-tap checkouts blur the line between browsing and borrowing.

Multiple micro-loans. It’s easier to carry five tiny debts than one obvious one—until they collide on the same payday.

Credit history gap. As credit scoring starts ingesting BNPL data (FICO, Affirm, Experian/TransUnion reporting), the “no impact” myth is fading—missed pay-in-four could soon dent scores. That’s a learning curve hitting the youngest cohort first.

Counterargument: Isn’t this just modern layaway? Sometimes, yes. Spreading cost across paydays for a textbook, train ticket, or winter coat can be rational. Australia’s experience shows BNPL can plug real affordability gaps as digital wallets scale (mobile wallet share hit 39% of card transactions in mid-2024). The danger isn’t the tool—it’s the stacking and the opacity of total cost.

UK reality, part two. Finder’s 2025 survey says 31% of Brits used BNPL in the past year and 13% were first-time users—new cohorts flowing in, not just repeat shoppers. Meanwhile, the FCA still counts millions struggling to pay bills in the cost-of-living aftershock. When essentials meet easy credit, BNPL shifts from lifestyle accessory to lifeline—and lifelines can fray.

So—surviving or sinking?

Surviving when: purchases are planned; installments match pay cycles; the total debt picture is visible; and BNPL is for needs or high-utility buys.

Sinking when: BNPL covers groceries between paychecks; multiple loans overlap; returns/refunds force you to pay the loan before you get the money back (a common pain point); and missed payments start to echo in credit files.

What better looks like (for Gen Z, brands, and regulators):

Truth at checkout. Show total cost, repayment dates, and the effect of a missed payment—no pastel hiding. (Firms already moving to bureau reporting should show the credit-score stakes clearly.) 
Business Insider

Stacking guardrails. Cap concurrent BNPL plans by income band; prompt users when three active plans overlap the same payday. (The FCA’s consultation hints where this could land.)

Budget-first defaults. Merchant and BNPL apps can nudge a “needs vs wants” toggle and a monthly cap—friction that saves futures.

Data with dignity. Credit bureaus and BNPLs must report consistently, so good behavior builds credit and bad behavior is flagged early—not years later. 
Experian

Bottom line. Gen Z aren’t reckless; they’re realistic. Wages are lumpy, prices are high, and the internet sells you life in four payments. BNPL/EMI can be a survival tool—until it becomes the water you’re swimming in. The job now is simple: keep the access, add the brakes.
