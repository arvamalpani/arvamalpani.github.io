# Palantir — A Case Study You Can Actually Read

*The goal here is simple: take the charts and numbers, and turn them into a story anyone can follow. No jargon. Just finance explained like a conversation.*

---

## Execetive summary 
- Palantir builds software that helps governments and businesses make sense of chaos.
- For years, it leaned heavily on government contracts. Now commercial is catching up fast—and that shift could reshape its value.
- Free cash flow has finally flipped positive. If that momentum holds, Palantir is no longer just “interesting tech”—it’s a real business.

## What Palantir Actually Sells
Think of Palantir as a “decision workbench.”  
- Forget the buzzwords. Palantir is basically a decision workbench.
- Governments use it for defense, intelligence, and fraud detection.
- Companies use it to manage supply chains, run plants, and model risk.
- Here’s the kicker: once Palantir lands inside an organization, it’s sticky as glue. Workflows get rebuilt around it. Ripping it out isn’t just hard—it’s painful.

## Revenue Trend

👉 What to watch:
Revenue is climbing—but here’s the real test:
- Can commercial catch government in size?
- Are new customers joining, or just old ones spending more?
- Is growth global—or still too U.S.-heavy?
- Growth without diversification is fragile.

## Free Cash Flow

Cash is truth. It’s what’s left after the lights are on and salaries are paid.
Palantir finally crossed into self-funded territory. That’s not just survival—it’s strength. Rising cash alongside rising revenue tells a story of growth that’s getting healthier, not riskier.

## Sensitivity (Why Analysts Disagree)

Valuation depends on two dials:  
- Here’s why opinions are so split: valuation rests on two knobs.
- WACC: how risky investors think Palantir is.
- Terminal growth: how fast you assume it grows forever.
- Twist either knob, and the “fair price” jumps. That’s why Wall Street targets feel like throwing darts. Lesson: don’t cling to one number. Think in ranges.
👉 Lesson: never trust one number — always think in ranges.  

---
## The Bull Case
- AIP (AI Platform) becomes the default “AI cockpit” for enterprises.
- Margins stay disciplined, so cash keeps compounding.
- Global expansion reduces dependence on U.S. government deals.
## The Bear Case
- Government budgets still swing results.
- Heavyweights like Microsoft, Snowflake, and Databricks fight for the same customers.
- Privacy and politics could slow adoption overseas. 

---

## How I’d Track It (Quarter to Quarter)
- If you want to cut through noise, watch these:
- Net new commercial customers (logos matter).
- GAAP operating margin (ignore “adjusted fairy dust”).
- Free cash flow vs. stock-based comp (cash is real; dilution is too).
- AIP adoption—are customers using it repeatedly, or just testing it once?

## Final Thought

Palantir is at a crossroads.

It’s no longer just a defense contractor with flashy pitch decks. It’s now a company throwing off real cash, with a shot at building an AI platform that sticks.

The story isn’t about predicting the “right” share price—it’s about momentum. If commercial growth keeps catching fire and cash flow holds, the bull case writes itself. If not, Palantir risks staying in government’s shadow.

👉 That’s the takeaway: numbers aren’t just data points. They’re a story. Palantir’s story is finally interesting—because it’s about choice, direction, and discipline.

## Proof of Work
- This isn’t hand-wavy:
- Rebuilt revenue + cash flow directly from filings.
- Ran a simple discounted cash flow model.
- Shared CSVs so anyone can check the math.
