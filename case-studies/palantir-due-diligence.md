# Palantir — A Case Study You Can Actually Read

*The goal here is simple: take the charts and numbers, and turn them into a story anyone can follow. No jargon. Just finance explained like a conversation.*

## TL;DR (the one-minute version)
- Palantir builds software that helps governments and companies make tough decisions with messy data.  
- Its business mix is shifting: once it was “mostly government,” now commercial is growing fast — that shift is critical for value.  
- Cash flow is finally solid. If that momentum holds, the bull case makes a lot more sense.

## What Palantir Actually Sells
Think of Palantir as a “decision workbench.”  
- Governments: defense, intelligence, fraud detection.  
- Companies: supply chain planning, plant operations, risk management.  

Once it’s in, it sticks. Teams build their workflows around it, and ripping it out is painful.

## The Numbers (Last 3 Years)
- **Revenue:** $1.91B (2022) → $2.23B (2023) → $2.87B (2024).  
- **Free Cash Flow:** $184M → $697M → $1.14B.  
- **Mix:** Government is still a little over half; commercial is the growth engine.

## Revenue Trend

👉 What to watch:
1. Is commercial catching up with government?  
2. Are *new* logos joining, not just existing clients paying more?  
3. Is growth global, or too US-heavy?

## Free Cash Flow

Cash is what’s left after you run the shop.  
This chart shows:  
- They crossed the “we fund ourselves” line.  
- Rising cash alongside rising revenue = healthier growth.

## Sensitivity (Why Analysts Disagree)

Valuation depends on two dials:  
- **WACC** (risk/return bar).  
- **Terminal growth** (forever growth assumption).  

👉 Lesson: never trust one number — always think in ranges.

## The Bull Case
- AIP (their AI platform) becomes the go-to “AI workbench.”  
- Margins stay disciplined → cash keeps compounding.  
- International growth reduces dependency on US government deals.  

## The Bear Case
- Government budget timing still drives results.  
- Big competition: Microsoft, Snowflake, Databricks.  
- Privacy concerns may slow adoption abroad.  

---

## How I’d Track It (Quarter to Quarter)
- Net new *commercial* customers.  
- GAAP operating margin (not just adjusted).  
- FCF vs. stock-based comp.  
- Whether AIP is showing repeatability.  

---

## Proof of Work
- Rebuilt revenue and FCF history from filings.  
- Ran a simple DCF (discounted cash flow).  
- Shared CSVs so anyone can check my math:

*The point isn’t to “predict a price.” It’s to show how raw numbers can be shaped into a clear, human story.*
